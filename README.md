# It's me Urbi! 👋

I'm a **Software Engineer** with **7+ years of experience**. I build full-stack web applications with Ruby on Rails and React, with a focus on real-time systems, API integrations, and making data work seamlessly across platforms.

## 💡 How I Add Value to Teams

**I ship features end-to-end**

From gathering requirements with stakeholders to deploying to production, I own features completely. Backend, frontend, database design, API integrations—I handle what needs to be done.

**I make integrations work**

Complex third-party APIs don't scare me. Meta Business, Twilio, Stripe, Google Maps, EMR platforms—I've integrated them all and made them reliable. I build data pipelines that sync information automatically across systems.

**I improve the codebase as I go**

I don't just add features—I leave things better than I found them. Whether it's refactoring for performance, adding missing test coverage, or optimizing SQL queries that are slowing things down, I care about the health of the codebase.

**I help the team move faster**

As a former Tech Lead, I know that good engineering practices compound over time. I've cut test runtimes in half, set up CI/CD pipelines, implemented design patterns that reduce complexity, and mentored developers through code reviews.

**I can lead when needed**

I've led teams, run retrospectives, and made technical decisions that balanced product needs with engineering quality. I know how to prioritize, communicate tradeoffs, and keep projects moving forward.
